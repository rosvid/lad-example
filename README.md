# LAD example

This project demonstrates a Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD) using Vaadin. This project was made as part of the "Plattformen und Systeme f√ºrs eLearning" course at the Goethe University Frankfurt.

For creating charts the ApexCharts add-on is used. The add-on is available at https://vaadin.com/directory/component/apexchartsjs.
For creating word clouds kumo is used. The library is available at https://github.com/kennycason/kumo.
For creating the map the LeafletMap add-on is used. The add-on is available at https://vaadin.com/directory/component/leafletmap-for-vaadin.

## Deploying and running to Production

The project can be built using the mvn clean package -Pproduction command. Then start the application using Spring Boot and open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

When first running the application the JSON file should be imported. This can be done by visiting http://localhost:8080/utils.
